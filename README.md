# ‚úîÔ∏è Meta State Machine
A high performance statemachine.
Big shoutout to [boost::msm](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html) for inspiring me to create this project.
I started this project to learn more about template metaprogramming while also making something very usefull for some of my other projects.
It is probably not as performant as boost::msm since they have put years of reasearch into it and probably use even less runtime stuff than I do here :)
