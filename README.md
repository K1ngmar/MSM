# ‚úîÔ∏è Meta State Machine
A high performance statemachine.
This project was inspired by [boost::msm](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html).
It is inted as a less complex implementation, though with that also less performant,
as this implementation uses a bit more runtime stuff to perform transitions.
It also has fewer features that boost::msm, though should still suffice for simple state machine implementations.
