# ‚úîÔ∏è Meta State Machine
A high performance headeronly compile time evaluated statemachine.
Big shoutout to [boost::msm](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html) for inspiring me to create this project.
I started this project to learn more about template metaprogramming while also making something very usefull for some of my other projects.
It is probably (definitely :sweat_smile:) not as complete and performant as boost::msm since they have put years of reasearch into it and use even less runtime stuff than I do here :)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
A C++ compiler that has c++20 support.

### Thread safety
By itself the statemachine is not thread safe, if you want to dispatch events from multiple events you would need to handle this yourself in the calls to `ProcessEvent();`.

### Event processing
If an event is dispatched whilst it is performing a transition the event will be stored in a queue and will be executed as soon as the current transition is finished. This means that if you decide to do a lot of computation in an `OnEntry()`, `OnExit()` etc. it will block the statemachine from perfoming transitions. Think carefull about how you implement these functions :)
